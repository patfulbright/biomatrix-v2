    Scoring Guidance:
    - Strategic Fit: Alignment with company mission, long-term vision, and core competencies.
    - Market Potential: Size, CAGR, competitive differentiation, and unmet need.
    - IP Position: Strength of patents, freedom to operate, licensing barriers.
    - Technical Feasibility: Maturity of the science, proof-of-concept status, scalability.
    - Development Cost: Total projected investment required to bring to market.
    - Time to Market: Time needed for R&D, trials, approval, and launch.
    - Regulatory Complexity: Likelihood and burden of obtaining regulatory approval.
    - Synergies: Ability to leverage existing platforms, partnerships, infrastructure, people.
    - ESG Impact: Environmental, social, and governance value creation.

    Instructions:
    - Score each category from 0â€“5.
